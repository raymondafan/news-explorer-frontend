### Overview

NewsExplorer is an advanced frontend application that revolutionizes the news browsing experience with its dynamic user interface and robust functionality. The project features intuitive UI components and modal windows for user registration and login, creating a seamless and engaging user experience. By integrating a sophisticated third-party news API, NewsExplorer offers powerful search capabilities and displays the latest articles, allowing users to find and view relevant news effortlessly. The application employs reusable React components styled using BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) principles, enhancing maintainability and consistency across the platform. Additionally, a custom back-end API is under development to manage user authentication and data storage, ensuring a secure and scalable solution for user interactions. To top it off, the user experience is further enhanced with animations and preloaders, providing a smooth and visually appealing navigation as users explore news articles.
